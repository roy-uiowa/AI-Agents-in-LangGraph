This repository contains implementations of AI agents built with LangGraph, covering core concepts from agent architecture to advanced features like persistent state management and human-in-the-loop workflows.

## Key Features

- 🏗️ **Agent Architecture**: Understand the division between LLM reasoning and system code
- 🔄 **LangGraph Implementation**: Build flow-based agents with state management
- 🔍 **Agentic Search**: Structured knowledge retrieval beyond traditional search
- 💾 **Persistence**: Save/load agent states across sessions
- 👩💻 **Human-in-the-Loop**: Integrate human feedback into agent workflows
- ✍️ **Essay Writing Agent**: Complete research and writing pipeline

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (or other LLM provider)
- Travily
- Optional: Docker for persistent storage examples

### Installation

```bash
